        <h2>I first started programming at the beginning of high school, and this was such a relief because I had found, at last, something that I liked studying. Throughout my two last years of high school, I learnt Python for the most part, but I also coded a website in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Thus, I will be able to lend a hand to Tim on the development of the website. However, I have chosen to be in charge of 2D/3D modelling and animation because I wish to learn something new and have always been drawn to the artistic part of games. Since I already do a lot of coding in algorithmic and programming classes it is interesting for me to study other aspects of computer science projects. This will enable me to stay open to other subjects. Finally, I look forward to working in collaboration with people that I know are motivated to produce the best game possible.

            <h2>I started coding in the 6th grade on Scratch and almost immediately after went to a coding school weekly. Since then, I continued and touched a lot of different domains such as Python, HTML, CSS and Arduino. In 12th grade in NSI class, we were tasked with the project of building a video game which led me to be part of a programming project not only as a developer but also by managing 10 people. Thanks to this experience I learned a lot and hope to share my knowledge with the rest of the group. This project will increase my experience and enjoyment of group programming projects. Throughout this project, I hope to learn more about unity and C# as I havenâ€™t had the opportunity to merge them during a big project and to learn a brand-new way to work in a team.

            <h2>My programming journey began with the CS50 introduction to a Computer Science course I started in 2020. I immediately concluded that this was the path I wanted to pursue. The course was in C++ which helped a lot when it came to learning C#. Most of my last two years of high school consisted of applied mathematics and physics, hence my enthusiasm to be a part of this group creating a video game that involves the physics of flight. Although this project will extend my knowledge in a more specific field of physics, having some prior understanding should prove useful for the team. I have never worked with websites, HTML or anything of the kind. Since I am in charge of creating the website, I am looking forward to developing the skills necessary to do so. I have created a simple game using Unity to familiarize myself before starting the project. I found that I thoroughly enjoyed the process. The idea of endless possibilities in programming will always keep it exciting.

          <h2>Ever since my youngest age, I have been passionate about computers and programming. During high school, I specialised in Computer Science and studied mostly Python. During high school, I developed many projects individually and in groups. This has taught me to be organized and to work in a team. Since I joined EPITA I have learned a lot, not only in algorithmic but also using tools that will be useful for the development of this project. I believe that my previous experience in programming will help my individual coding in C# but mostly be a good teammate. I believe this project will teach me more about teamwork and game development while enriching my coding skills. I also hope that this project will teach me about long term projects and particularly the organization and communication skills they require. I look forward to collaborating with this team as I believe I will learn a lot from all of them but also look forward to developing this stimulating project.
